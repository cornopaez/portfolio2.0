  description: 'I am a former musician who\'s discovered the joy of coding. I initially learned to code in Java, building small programs for my classes, including some that used SQL databases in the stack. I am handy with SQL and traditional relational database schema design and queries. Iâ€™ve since moved on to using a MEAN as my main stack, using it to build this site and deploying exclusively to Heroku. I am familiar and feel comfortable in the languages and technologies below. Feel free to poke around the site and contact me if you have any questions.'
