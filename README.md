# Portfolio2.0

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.4.

#Welcome

Thank you for stopping by. This is the repo for my portfolio, in its second iteration. It has been built from the ground up using Angular CLI and Angluar 2 and 4. If you have any questions, [drop me a line](https://www.cornopaez.com/Contact/form).

#Usage

You may clone this repo to your localhost for testing. But I must warn you: the site works best if there's a MongoDB instance containing and receiving information necessary for this site. That said, some pages will not work at all (Projects view, Project Details view, and Contact form submission). These errors are handled gracefully by Angular and will always end in the error route.

##Cloning and deployment

`
git clone https://github.com/cornopaez/portfolio2.0
npm install
ng build
node server.js
`
